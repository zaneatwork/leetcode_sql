Leetcode SQL 50
===============

This is my take on the [Leetcode SQL 50](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/) challenge!

Each directory corresponds to a leetcode practice problem number and includes the challenge and related table structure as comments at the top of the file.
All solutions target PostgreSQL but ANSI SQL is preferred where reasonable.
